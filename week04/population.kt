/*
Write a program that will predict the size of a population of organisms.
The program should ask for the starting number of organisms, their average daily population increase (as a percentage),
and the number of days they will multiply. For example, a population might begin with two organisms,
have an average daily increase of 50 percent, and will be allowed to multiply for seven days.
The program should use a loop to display the size of the population for each day.

Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size of the population.
Do not accept a negative number for the average daily population increase.
Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days they will multiply.
